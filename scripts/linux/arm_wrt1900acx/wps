# Description: This script is in charge of modifying the default behavior of
#              the WPS hardware button in a Linksys 1900 AC device, running
#              OpenWRT.
#
#              This script must be copied in the /etc/rc.button directory.
#
#              The WPS button will be reconfigured to execute two actions:
#
#                1) If the button is pressed less than 1 second, it will
#                   toggle the WIFI 'radio 1' to ON or OFF, depending of its
#                   previous state.
#                   This is useful to switch ON or OFF the WIFI without
#                   entering in the Web configuration page.
#
#                2) If the button is pressed more than 3 seconds, it will
#                   start the 1905 Push Button procedure.
#                   Depending on the configuration, this procedure will secure
#                   all device interfaces, and clone the WIFI configuration 
#                   from another device.
#                   For more information about the Push Button procedure,
#                   please read the README file provided with the 1905 stack
#                   implementation.
