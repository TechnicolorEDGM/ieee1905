// 'mid' is the "message id" of the "push button event notification" message
// that caused this function to be called. This value will later be reported
// back to the AL entity in the "PLATFORM_QUEUE_EVENT_AUTHENTICATED_LINK"
// message.
//
//   NOTE:
//     When this function is called as a result of the user pressing a button
//     in the local device (versus receiving a remote "push button event
//     notification message" from another node) then 'al_mac_address' and 'mid'
//     contain the values that go inside the "push button event notification"

//
//   A) The "push button" configuration process is stopped (because no one
//      answered at the other end of the link or because something failed)
//      after some technology-specific time.
//
//   B) The "push button" configuration is stopped because a new device has been
//      added. When this happens, a new message of type
//      "PLATFORM_QUEUE_EVENT_AUTHENTICATED_LINK" is posted to the system
//      queue.
//
// If there is a problem and the process cannot be started, this function
// returns "0", otherwise it returns "1"

//   If "interface_name" does not support the "push button" configuration
//   mechanism, this function should immediatley return "1".
//   Ie. a "PLATFORM_QUEUE_EVENT_AUTHENTICATED_LINK" message must *not* be
//   posted to the AL queue.
//
// [PLATFORM PORTING NOTE]
//   Note that once the process is started and until it finishes, if someone
//   calls "PLATFORM_GET_1905_INTERFACE_INFO()" on this interface, the field
//   'push_button_on_going' must return a value of "1".
