#include "1905_cmdus.h"

// "MIDs" are "message IDs" used inside 1905 protocol messages. They must be
// monotonically increased as explained in "Section 7.8"
//
INT16U getNextMid(void);

// Returns '1' if the packet has already been processed in the past and thus,
// should be discarded (to avoid network storms). '0' otherwise.
//
// According to what is explained in "Sections 7.5, 7.6 and 7.7" if a
// defragmented packet whose "AL MAC address TLV" and "message id" match one
// that has already been received in the past, then it should be discarded.
//
// I *personally* think the standard is "slightly" wrong here because *not* all
// CMDUs contain an "AL MAC address TLV".
// We could use the ethernet source address instead, however this would only
// work for those messages that are *not* relayed (one same duplicated relayed
// message can arrive at our local node with two different ethernet source
// addresses).
// Fortunately for us, all relayed CMDUs *do* contain an "AL MAC address TLV",
// thus this is what we are going to do:
//
//   1. If the CMDU is a relayed one, check against the "AL MAC" contained in
//      the "AL MAC address TLV"
//
//   2. If the CMDU is *not* a relayed one, check against the ethernet source
//      address
//
// This function keeps track of the latest MAX_DUPLICATES_LOG_ENTRIES tuples
// of ("mac_address", "message_id") and:
//
//   1. If the provided tuple matches an already existing one, this function
//      returns '1'
//
//   2. Otherwise, the entry is added (discarding, if needed, the oldest entry)
//      and this function returns '0'
//
