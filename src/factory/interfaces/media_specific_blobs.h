// Main API functions
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

// This function receives a pointer to a "genericInterfaceType" structure and
// then allocates and returns a buffer holding the array of bytes that should
// be inserted in the 1905 "media_specific" fields present in several TLVs
// ("generic phy device information TLV", "push button generic phy event
// notification TLV" and "power off interface TLV").
//
// This function "translates" the "genericInterfaceType" structure fields
// specific for each supported interface type into a stream of bytes according
// to the corresponding standard that applies to each particular type of
// interface.
//
// The returned pointer can later be free with "free_media_specific_blob()"
//
// 'len' is an output argument that holds the length of the returned buffer.
//
INT8U *forge_media_specific_blob(struct genericInterfaceType *m, INT16U *len);

// 'forge_media_specific_blob()' returns a regular buffer which can be freed
// using this macro defined to be PLATFORM_FREE
//
#define  free_media_specific_blob  PLATFORM_FREE
